# SpringTutorial â€“ Learn Spring Framework step by step
This Spring Tutorial Dependency Injection use Eclipse IDE and Maven tool to build and manage depencencies of
the project. So you have to download all dependencies as in a previous step 1.


## Part 2: Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring, What is Dependency Injection?
Dependency Injection means injecting the dependency between two
object as per as our requirement in our application,
this help to reducing the dependency to each other and more beneficiary to unit testing of every objects independently.

Every java based application has a few objects that work
together to present what the end-user sees as a working application.
When writing a complex Java application, application classes should be as independent as possible of other
Java classes to increase the possibility to reuse these classes and to test them independently of other
classes while doing unit testing

## Advantages of Dependency Injection
1. Reducing the dependency to each other of objects in application.
2. Every objects in application could individually unit testing with different mock implementation.
3. Loosely couple or it promotes decoupling to application
4. Promotes re-usability of code or objects in different applications
5. Promotes logical abstraction of components.

## More into App.java class
Spring framework has two types of dependency of injection:
1. <b> Dependency with Constructor Injection</b>
2. <b> Dependency with Setter Injection </b>
